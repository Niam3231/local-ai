# Local AI
Use local AI modells without annoying installations, no nmp, docker, python, pip and so on, just use the build in php and php-curl -S system. Works on WSL. Easy to install. I am not joking, just run the .sh install script, wait for the installation to complete and go on your browser to localhost:3231 and chat with your local AI!
### Installation
Execute the following command on linux, can also be WSL or UserLand if you know what you are doing.
``` bash
curl -o start.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Niam3231/local-ai/main/start.sh
sudo chmod +x ./start.sh && ./start.sh
```
Done! Just anwser if you already installed it and you get your own local private AI.
